Basic types:
  (to understand what cases we should use in each type)

  Primitive types:
    They are the most basic types, primitive types are simple values that have no
    properties. 

    1. 'string': Represents a sequence of Unicode characters
    2. 'number': Represents both integers and floating-point numbers
    3. 'boolean': Represents a logical true or false
    4. 'undefined': Represents a value that hasn't been initialized yet
    5. 'null': Represents no value 

  Types annotations:
    In Javascript, types for variables can also change at runtime. For example,
    a variable that holds a number can later be replaced by a string.
    (Usually, this is unwanted behaviour and can result in a bug in our app.)

    Typescript annotations let us declare variables with specific types when we
    writing our code. This allows the TypeScript compiler to check that the code
    adheres to these types before the code executes at runtime.
